This is my solution to the Hipmunk Lessenger Coding Challenge.

**To install**:
* Clone this repository.
* Run `./install.sh`.
* Create a file named `config.py` with the required API keys. Look at `config.py.example` for an example of what this file should look like.

**To run**: run `./run.sh`.

**To run in debug mode**: run `./run_dev.sh`.
